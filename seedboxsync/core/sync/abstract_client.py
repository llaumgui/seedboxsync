        Retrieve size about a file on the remote system.  The return
        value is an object whose attributes correspond to the attributes of
        Python's ``stat`` structure as returned by ``os.stat``, except that it
        contains fewer fields.  An SFTP server may return as much or as little
        info as it wants, so the results may vary from server to server.

        Unlike a Python `python:stat` object, the result may not be accessed as
        a tuple.  This is mostly due to the author's slack factor.
        The fields supported are: ``st_mode``, ``st_size``, ``st_uid``,
        ``st_gid``, ``st_atime``, and ``st_mtime``.
